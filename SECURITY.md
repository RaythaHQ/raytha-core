## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days with our assessment
- We will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Disclosure Policy

- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- We will publish a security advisory with full credit to you (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We coordinate public disclosure with you and will wait for your approval before publishing

### Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Act in good faith
- Do not access more data than necessary
- Do not modify or destroy data
- Do not violate any laws
- Provide us with a reasonable time to fix the issue before disclosure
